# OpenGl simulations
This is a project I was building during my 1st year in college to learn modern openGL(3.3). 
You can learn more about it from [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/)

There are many files in this project which you can run and test yourself. These are the dependencies you need to get for liinux systems -
* libglew-dev
* libglfw3-dev
* mesa-common-dev


# Building
To compile and run any of the simulation, you need to type
	g++ filename.cpp -lGL -glut -lGLU -lGLEW -lglfw

# Examples
